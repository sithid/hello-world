# hello-world
This repository is for practising the GitHub Flow.
I am 38 years old.  I have taken some college, but have no degree. When it is time to make our choise, I will choose the Software Development pathway.  I have learned java and python in college but I have worked with C# for over 15 years.  I also know some C and C++ from when I used to code MUDs.
